### INTRODUCTION

DAY 1 Lecture Summary

  - Learned how VLSI technology integrates millions of tiny transistors into chips, enabling faster, smaller, and more affordable electronics.

  - Explored the Arduino board to see why its central microcontroller unit (MCU) is crucial.

  - The MCU handles everything—from reading sensors to controlling lights—thanks to VLSI advancements.

  - The Arduino board includes key components like the microprocessor (the brain of the system), voltage regulator, I/O pins, and communication interfaces, all working together to perform various tasks.

<li> Chip Packaging and Components </li>
<br>
  - Facilities that manufacture chips, called 'FOUNDRIES', are crucial because they determine the chip’s efficiency and performance.

<br>
  - Inside these chips are pre-designed digital blocks called 'MACROS' that help improve the chip’s functionality and speed.

<br>

Chips are generally made up of three major physical parts:

1) <b>Core</b>: The central zone where the full logic circuit is laid out.

2) <b>Pads</b>: Act as gateways for electrical signals to move in and out of the chip.

3) <b>Die<b>: Represents the total silicon area of the chip that contains both logic and I/O components.

Process Design Kit is PDK data which contains information about the manufacturing process. In 2020, Google collaborated with **SkyWater Technology** to release an **open-source FOSS 130nm** Production PDK.

Above shows simplified RTL to GDSII flow.Steps invloved are explained as follows:

**Step 1 – Synthesis:**
This step converts the RTL design into a gate-level netlist using pre-designed blocks from the Standard Cell Library (SCL). These standard cells come in regular shapes but different sizes to perform basic logic functions.

**Step 2 – Floorplanning & Power Planning:**
Here, we decide the layout of major blocks on the chip—where inputs, outputs, and various components should go to save space.
Power planning involves setting up the chip's power supply network (VDD and GND) using dedicated routing structures.

**Step 3 – Placement:**
Standard cells are placed in their planned locations. This happens in two stages:

 Global Placement – Rough positioning of cells.

 Detailed Placement – Fine-tuning of exact cell positions.

**Step 4 – Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):**
The clock signal is distributed throughout the chip using special tree-like structures to ensure it reaches all parts at the same time, preventing timing delays.

**Step 5 – Routing:**
Once placement and clock planning are done, we connect all components using metal layers:

 Global Routing – Planning the paths.

 Detailed Routing – Drawing the exact wire routes.

**Step 6 – Sign-off Checks:**
In the final step, the design is checked for correctness:

 DRC (Design Rule Check) – Ensures layout follows manufacturing rules.

 LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) – Confirms that layout matches the circuit design.

 STA (Static Timing Analysis) – Verifies the design meets timing constraints.

 
## OPENLANE AND STRIVE CHIPSETS

OpenLane began as an open-source project aiming to facilitate a genuine open-source tape-out experiment. It originated from e-fabless and serves as a platform that incorporates various tools like **Yosys, OpenRoad, Magic, KLlayout**, and other open-source tools. OpenLane streamlines the different stages of silicon implementation, making them easier to understand and work with. At e-fabless, they have a series of SOC (System on Chip) designs called Strive. Strive SOCs are entirely open, featuring open PDK (Process Design Kit), open RTL (Register Transfer Level), and open EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.

The Main aim of Openlane is to **produce clean GDSII without human intervention.**
