### INTRODUCTION

DAY 1 Lecture Summary

Learned how VLSI technology integrates millions of tiny transistors into chips, enabling faster, smaller, and more affordable electronics.

Explored the Arduino board to see why its central microcontroller unit (MCU) is crucial.

The MCU handles everything—from reading sensors to controlling lights—thanks to VLSI advancements.

The Arduino board includes key components like the microprocessor (the brain of the system), voltage regulator, I/O pins, and communication interfaces, all working together to perform various tasks.

<li> Chip Packaging and Components </li>
<br>
Facilities that manufacture chips, called 'FOUNDRIES', are crucial because they determine the chip’s efficiency and performance.

<br>
Inside these chips are pre-designed digital blocks called 'MACROS' that help improve the chip’s functionality and speed.

<br>
Chips are generally made up of three major physical parts:

Core – The central zone where the full logic circuit is laid out.

Pads – Act as gateways for electrical signals to move in and out of the chip.

Die – Represents the total silicon area of the chip that contains both logic and I/O components.
